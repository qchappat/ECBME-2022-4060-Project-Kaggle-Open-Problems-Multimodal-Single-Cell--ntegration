# ECBME-2022-4060-Project-Kaggle-Open-Problems-Multimodal-Single-Cell-Integration
ECBME 2022 Project by Zachary ABESSERA, Quentin CHAPPAT, Kevin HOFFER-HAWLIK and Crystal SHIN.

Our project is based on the data available from the Kaggle Competition [Open Problems - Multimodal Single-Cell Integration](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/open-problems-multimodal) and consists in the prediction of protein levels given gene expressions.

We made different models to understand and evaluate how patient-specific, or independent, is the genetic information.

We built 5 different models, available in this repository, and work on the results of each model for our analyzis.
